# Terminal Definitions

A little terminal app for showing a new word and its definition in the terminal each minute.
Also a personal experiment with using the [blessed](https://github.com/chjj/blessed) library.

## TODOs (Someday-maybes)

- [ ] Add and link binary for global install
- [ ] Update `definitionAnalysis.js` to analyze/process substrings as well as individual words
